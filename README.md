# Movie Recommendation Using TMDB REST API

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.6.

This project uses the TMDB (The Movie Database) REST API to build a movie recommendation system. It allows users to get movie recommendations based on their preferences and displays details like movie title, overview, cast details, release date, watch trailer, etc.
